# GEOG476 - GIS Practicum
### A 6 month project where me and a partner worked on providing a solution to water sustainability over the next 50 years in Hays County, Texas, in a reasearch setting. To do this we designed a sustainability index and made use of excel, ArcGIS Pro, and python to compute the data that we needed to reach a conclusion.
